# CaptivePortal
A wrapper for [linux-router](https://github.com/garywill/linux-router/) to make a captive portal.

### Usage ###
* Make the necessary changes in the global variables of `captive`
* Put your static site for the captive portal in site/
* `sudo ./captive`

Currently, if the script crashes it may not do a proper cleanup
